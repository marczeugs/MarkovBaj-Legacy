Those seen as hostile to Israel, on the other hand, can be sure that AIPAC will direct campaign contributions to their political opponents. ... The bottom line is that AIPAC, which is a de facto agent for a foreign government, has a stranglehold on the U.S. Congress. Open debate about U.S. policy towards Israel does not occur there, even though that policy has important consequences for the entire world. -The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy‚Äù.                                                                       To have lobbies and financial dependencies is ridiculous in the first place, and is kind of a mockery of true democracy.

This is mainly due to increased involvement of reddit admins deleting comments and posts, which signals to me that there's too much content that violates reddit rules. Usually these removals will show for me in the moderation log as Anti-evil operations, but recently there's been a lot of removals that don't leave any logs. Which to me seems like the end is near.\r  \n\r  \nAddition to this I have to admit that my own judgement is getting blurry where I feel like I have a hard time seeing the joke or sarcasm in a post and removing them left and right in fear of the whole subreddit getting banned. And this is one of the main reasons I need a helping hand from new people, removing content that clearly breaks the rules. In the end in low moderation environment bending the rules becomes a hobby for some people.\r  \n\r  \nThere currently are a lot of automoderator rules in place which help to defuse situations for a little while, making it harder for people to make new accounts and keep breaking the rules. These will most likely be removed or at least made less strict with additional mods.\r  \n\r  \nMaximum of 5 mods will be added if there's enough qualified candidates. The users will receive mod, with power to manage/remove posts and comments at first, and if they have more interest in other areas what subreddit mods do, it's possible to get more mod power. Preferably people from different timezones so there's people online at most times. If the mod goes rogue, removing content that should not be removed, they will get their mod status removed and the posts/comments will be restored. Just in case that someone thinks there's any pay in this, there's not. You will be doing janitor duty for free.\r  \n\r  \nRules the mods will enforce\r  \n\r  \nRemoving racism and other hate speech\r  \n\r  \nRemoving brigading posts or comments this involves pictures of other reddit users names\r  \n\r  \nRemoving otherwise questionable content\r  \n\r  \nIf you are interested you can private message me. People that feel like keeping anonymity and participate in mindless comments without fear being labeled as janny I would suggest creating a new account.\r  \n\r  \nMod positions are full for now. More will be added when needed.","get a life you fat bot","Everybody in uganda knows kong fu","!forsenbot","Streamer = cant Go outside LULE","yeah but you don't do whatever you want to do, you just sit in your house all day playing games, getting bored of them and becoming really unhappy like most streamers","you have nothing of value to say lol stop trying to be funny for internet points","also a weeb OMEGALUL","Not true!

And even though his chat is toxic and lowkey racist its just like 20% of his viewers while others just watch chat can also be pretty immature which just makes it more funny cause youre just laughing at immature people, like spamming i lost everytime they see a girl. And his pepega and rage moments make it more entertaining same reason people like dumb characters in shows and movies.

Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you‚Äôd choose the chair. That‚Äôs because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you‚Äôd have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated ‚Äî thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äî than the chair market.\n\n\nDoes that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you‚Äôre more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government.

That's very debatable. And if a streamer bans the emote because of ethnic jokes, I will indeed argue that that is what the emote is for.
